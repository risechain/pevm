# Ideally criterion would give us access to the benchmarked numbers via Rust
# API. They don't, so we must read from the output JSON files. They also don't
# expose the estimate types in Rust so we need to parse it manually. Picking
# Python with no error handling for dev speed and future plotting. We only use
# this for a quick report during performance tuning anyway.
